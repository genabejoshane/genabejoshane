# Tiny Rice Leaf Disease Classifier (Synthetic Demo)

This is a small demo project that shows **how to build, train, and deploy** a simple CNN image classifier.
It uses a tiny *synthetic* image dataset (generated programmatically) so you can run everything locally without downloading large datasets.

## Contents
- `dataset/` - synthetic images generated by `dataset_generator.py`
- `train.py` - trains a tiny CNN and saves `model.h5`
- `predict.py` - command-line predictor using `model.h5`
- `app.py` - minimal Flask API to upload an image and get prediction
- `requirements.txt` - Python packages needed
- `model.h5` - trained model (NOT included here; run `train.py` to create it)
- `README.md` - this file

## How to run (local)
1. Create virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # mac/linux
   venv\\Scripts\\activate    # windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. (Optional) regenerate dataset:
   ```
   python dataset_generator.py
   ```

3. Train model (will read from `dataset/train` and `dataset/test`):
   ```
   python train.py
   ```

4. Run Flask API:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
   POST an image file (form field name `image`) to `http://localhost:5000/predict`

## Notes
This is intentionally tiny and synthetic for demo purposes. Replace the dataset with real images for a useful model.
